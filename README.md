# Felipe Inostroza Meneses

## Description
This project aims to introduce skills oriented to microservices programming in conjunction with Spring Boot Java.

## Installation
To run the program, first clone from the following repository in the Development branch,
Once you have the code, access the folder called "felipe-inostroza-meneses", within that folder from a terminal run:

mvn spring-boot:run

(note : Make sure you have Maven installed for your operating system)

Once the code is executed, in the same root you can see that there is a folder called web-page, in it there is a folder called html in which you can visually see (and very basic) the game interface. To do this, open the index.html file in your browser.
## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
